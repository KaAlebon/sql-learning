Delivery Performance Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyses logistics delivery performance using SQL and SQLite.

The aim is to understand delivery volumes, delivery performance, driver activity, and regional trends using a structured operational dataset.

Tools Used
SQLite
DB Browser for SQLite
SQL
GitHub
Dataset
The project uses four datasets:

deliveries
drivers
regions
vehicles
Business Questions Investigated
Which region handled the most deliveries?
How many deliveries were completed on time versus late?
Which drivers completed the most deliveries?
Which region has the longest average delivery time?
Key Findings
Delivery Volume by Region
Delivery volumes were evenly distributed across all regions.

Region	Deliveries
South	13
North	13
West	12
East	12
Delivery Status
Delivery performance was evenly split:

Status	Deliveries
On Time	25
Late	25
This indicates a 50% on-time delivery rate.

Driver Activity
Jamie and Jordan completed the highest number of deliveries with 3 deliveries each.

Most drivers completed 2 deliveries.

Average Delivery Time by Region
Region	Average Delivery Time (Minutes)
South	65.69
West	63.83
North	42.54
East	30.58
South recorded the longest average delivery time.

Current Status
✅ Database created

✅ Data imported into SQLite

✅ Documentation started

✅ Initial operational analysis completed

🔄 Further investigation required to understand why delivery times differ between regions.

Next Steps
Investigate the factors affecting delivery times.
Compare delivery time against distance travelled.
Analyse driver performance in more detail.
Explore vehicle usage patterns.
Build visualisations in Power BI.
